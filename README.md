# What is Squidex?

Squidex is an open source headless CMS and content management hub. In contrast to an traditional CMS Squidex provides a rich API with OData filter support and Swagger Definitions. It is up to you to build you UI on top of it. It can be website, a native App or just another server. 
We built it on top of ASP.NET Core and CQRS and is tested for Windows and Linux on modern Browsers.
